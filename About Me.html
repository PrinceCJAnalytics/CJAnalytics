										<h2>Statistical Coding Software Expertise</h2>
									</header>
								
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>My proficiency in Python is central to my data science and analytics services. I leverage its powerful libraries like Pandas for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing, and NumPy for complex numerical computations. For developing predictive models and implementing machine learning solutions, particularly in areas aligning with my research interests in AI, I utilize Scikit-learn and other relevant packages. In my services, this translates to building custom solutions for data-driven decision-making, from exploratory data analysis to deploying machine learning applications. </p>
									<p>In Training: I introduce Python as a foundational language for aspiring data scientists and analysts. My courses cover everything from basic syntax to advanced applications in data manipulation with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and an introduction to machine learning concepts, ensuring learners gain practical, hands-on experience.</p>
								
									<h3>R</h3>
									<p>With a strong background in statistical analysis, R is a key tool in my arsenal. I use R for advanced statistical modeling, in-depth data exploration, and creating high-quality, publication-ready visualizations, particularly for projects requiring rigorous statistical backing. Its extensive package ecosystem, including the Tidyverse, allows me to conduct nuanced data analysis and support complex research, including areas like probability distributions and competing risks analysis. </p>
									<p>In Training: When teaching R, I focus on its strengths in statistical computing and data visualization. I guide learners through using RStudio, understanding data structures, and applying statistical tests and models. My training emphasizes reproducible research using R Markdown, enabling students to produce comprehensive analytical reports.</p>
								
									<h3>SQL</h3>
									<p>My expertise in SQL allows me to efficiently manage, query, and manipulate data stored in relational databases. In my data analytics services, I use SQL to extract, filter, aggregate, and prepare large datasets for detailed analysis or for use in other analytical tools. This is crucial for tasks ranging from customer segmentation to performance metric tracking, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval.</p>
									<p>In Training: I teach SQL as an essential skill for anyone working with data. My training covers writing effective queries to retrieve and manipulate data, understanding database structures, and performing complex operations like JOINs and aggregations, equipping learners with the ability to interact confidently with databases.</p>

									<h3>Power BI</h3>
									<p>I utilize Power BI to transform complex datasets into clear, interactive, and actionable dashboards and reports. My services include developing custom BI solutions that help clients visualize their data, track key performance indicators, and gain insights for better decision-making. I focus on creating intuitive and impactful visualizations that tell a compelling story with data.</p>
									<p>In Training: In my Power BI training sessions, I empower users to connect to various data sources, perform data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, model data, and create dynamic reports and dashboards. The emphasis is on practical application, enabling participants to quickly leverage Power BI for their own analytical needs.</p>
								
									<h3>Excel</h3>
									<p>While adept with more advanced tools, I recognize the continued importance and versatility of Excel in data analysis. I use Excel for quick data exploration, cleaning, creating pivot tables for data summarization, and developing straightforward visualizations. It's often a practical tool for initial data handling and for clients who primarily operate within the Microsoft Office ecosystem.</p>
									<p>In Training: My Excel training for data analysis covers essential functions, data cleaning techniques, creating effective charts, and mastering PivotTables. I aim to help learners maximize Excel's capabilities for everyday data tasks and build a solid foundation for more advanced analytics.</p>
								
									<h3>Minitab</h3>
									<p>My experience with Minitab is particularly relevant for projects requiring robust statistical analysis, especially in areas like quality control and process improvement, which can overlap with my interest in optimum sampling. I use Minitab for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and Design of Experiments (DOE).</p>
									<p>In Training: When incorporating Minitab into teaching, I focus on its application in statistical problem-solving. Students learn to navigate its interface, perform various statistical tests, and interpret the output, making it accessible for those needing to apply statistical methods in fields like engineering or quality assurance.</p>
								
									<h3>SPSS</h3>
									<p>With my background in statistical education and services, SPSS is another tool I am proficient in, particularly for quantitative data analysis common in survey research and social sciences. I utilize SPSS for tasks such as descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis, and predictive modeling for specific research questions.</p>
									<p>In Training: I teach SPSS by focusing on its user-friendly interface for conducting complex statistical analyses. My training covers data entry and management, performing a wide range of statistical tests, and interpreting the results, which is invaluable for students and professionals in research-oriented fields.</p>
								
									<h3>Tableau</h3>
									<p>I leverage Tableau to create sophisticated and highly interactive data visualizations and dashboards. My services involve using Tableau to help clients explore their data dynamically, uncover hidden patterns, and communicate complex information in an accessible visual format. This is key to delivering impactful data stories and enabling insightful business intelligence.</p>
									<p>In Training: My Tableau training focuses on equipping individuals with the skills to connect to data, design compelling visualizations, and build interactive dashboards. Participants learn to use Tableau's drag-and-drop interface effectively, create calculated fields, and share their insights, transforming them into proficient data storytellers.</p>
